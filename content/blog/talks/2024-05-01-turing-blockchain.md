On the 1st of May in collaboration with "Turing" school I gave a lecture about blockhcain internals.
[slides](/slides/2024-05-01-turing-blockchain.pdf) and [video](https://youtu.be/8OB97iBm31I?si=Wv_4aLTUeiXQy0v0) (in Russian).

BTW, this presentation is written in [typst](https://typst.app/), you can check the code in this [repo](https://github.com/totikom/slides/tree/main/2024-05-01-turing-blockchain) (my other talks will likely be stored there).
