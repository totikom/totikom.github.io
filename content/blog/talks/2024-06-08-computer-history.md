Two weeks ago I gave a talk about history of computing machinery in [Locus Solus](https://yandex.eu/maps/org/locus_solus/1692971085/) book shop.
[slides](/slides/2024-06-08-computer-history.pdf) (in Russian).

BTW, this presentation is written in [typst](https://typst.app/), you can check the code in this [repo](https://github.com/totikom/slides/tree/main/2024-06-08-computer-history) (my other talks are stored there).
