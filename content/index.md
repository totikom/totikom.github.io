I'm totikom and that's my small site.

IRL may name is Eugene[^1] Lomov and I'm a compiler engineer trying to make DSP code faster.

While not at work, I'm playing with different tech stuff or infodumping my knowledge to those who didn't get away.

[^1] Evgeny, Evgenii or whatever the correct transliteration is.
